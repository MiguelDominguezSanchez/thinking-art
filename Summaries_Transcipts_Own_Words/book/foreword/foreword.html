                The blooming field Philosophy of Art is, is enhanced by the increase of its pupils and the information.
                No wonder, if Art had not exited Philosophy of Art would have not occurred.
                Art has been flowering at a bewildering measure.
                In fact, its growth stills speeding up.
                An uncanny spread of art movements.
                To nourish the encounter with Art, the neophyte deserves a proper introduction. A meeting place like Owl of Minerva channel will invigorate the background of the interested ones to comprehend art world.
                Philosophy of Art is a difficult field, due to its ungraspability in contrast with other Philosophy areas.
                In the Theory of Knowledge we need no other thing than ourselves to reflect, to translate our cognition, thoughts, and knowledge philosophically.
                Aestheticians cope with an unidentifiable myriad of Arts, even new taxonomy, not only with the recognized (constituted) ones. Music, Sculpture, Painting etc.
                What is a Marcel DuchampÂ´s urinary placed (allocated) in a museum gallery? (turning point)(work)(whim)(piece). Is it Art? and  if so what discipline? is it a performance? a sculpture? The poetic license of the artist entails unnumbered quantities presupposed by the subject matter of Philosophy of Art, due to the fact that it is a cultural phenomenon. An heterogeneous, unsettled and ambiguos matter. A proper introduction must tackle the bowels, in and outs, twists and turns of the subject.
                A simplistic social initiation for the newcoommer is not enough. A philosophical approach is required to match a decent settlement of foundations of honest awareness (authentic)(legitimate) of the field. A those already read will enrich (enhance) with a crisp insight at recognizable things.
