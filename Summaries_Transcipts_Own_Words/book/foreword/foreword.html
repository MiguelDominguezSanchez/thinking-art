                Owl of Minerva is a channel in spanish and english in where Philosophy of Art is tackled.*1
                The blooming field Philosophy of Art is, is enhanced by the increase of its pupils and the information.
                No wonder, if Art had not exited Philosophy of Art would have not occurred.
                Art has been flowering at a bewildering measure.
                In fact, its growth stills speeding up.
                An uncanny spread of art movements.
                To nourish the encounter with Art, the neophyte deserves a proper introduction. A meeting place like Owl of Minerva channel will invigorate the background of the interested ones to comprehend art world.
                Philosophy of Art is a difficult field, due to its ungraspability in contrast with other Philosophy areas.
                In the Theory of Knowledge we need no other thing than ourselves to reflect, to translate our cognition, thoughts, and knowledge philosophically.
                Aestheticians cope with an unidentifiable myriad of Arts, even new taxonomy, not only with the recognized (constituted) ones. Music, Sculpture, Painting etc.
                What is a Marcel Duchamp´s urinary placed (allocated) in a museum gallery? (turning point)(work)(whim)(piece). Is it Art? and  if so what discipline? is it a performance? a sculpture? The poetic license of the artist entails unnumbered quantities presupposed by the subject matter of Philosophy of Art, due to the fact that it is a cultural phenomenon. An heterogeneous, unsettled and ambiguos matter. A proper introduction must tackle the bowels, in and outs, twists and turns of the subject.
                A simplistic social initiation for the newcoommer is not enough. A philosophical approach is required to match a decent settlement of foundations of honest awareness (authentic)(legitimate) of the field. A those already read will enrich (enhance) with a crisp insight at recognizable things.
                To consummate this aim. the path  might be tackled (into) diverse manners. A wide-reaching historical slant, debating meaning business what the theoreticians said regarding to art. Or it may be carried out by putting the focus on a particular point concerned-aligned treatment, with touches of history.

                Each procedure returns assets; although a singular inquiry of each one debase the depiction of a ground nurtured by a substance cluster of matters unfolding in a captivating way.
                We are going to acquire a halfway acquaintanceship.
                Providing an accomplished impression of the Aesthetics old days, however with no focus for a singular aesthete debate and showoff archival refinement by itself.
                We are philosophizing, not chiseling ideas out in the History frontispiece.
                Our objective is to narrate the explanation of decisive characters in Aesthetics History and make present the issues and lines that involve theorists who reflect in relation to art, from the very beginning to our days.
                Or form the other insight, present the problems touched on by aesthetes clarifying them nourished by the historial endeavors to tackle them.
                We are no implicated in ostentatious and visionary juggling stunts that are intangible and sublime (going beyond the limit) that go above and beyond the art pieces per se.
